#!/bin/bash

# Bash (Bourne Again SHELL) is a type of program that lets you talk to your computer's operating system.
# It's used a lot on different kinds of computers and is the main way to give commands on most Linux systems.

# Let's start by making the computer say "Hello World".

echo "Hello World" # To see this work, you need to open your computer's command line
# tool (like Terminal on Mac/Linux) and run this script using
# the command './1_intro.sh'.

# What 'echo' does:
# The 'echo' command is like saying "show this text on the screen". It's similar
# to the 'print()' function in Python or 'console.log()' in JavaScript, which you
# might know from web development. It takes what you give it and displays it.

# About that funny line at the top: '#!/bin/bash'
# You might be wondering what that '#!/bin/bash' thing at the very top means.
# It's called the "shebang" (some people also call it "hashbang"). Don't worry if
# it looks strange! It's just a special instruction for your computer. It tells
# the computer to use the Bash program to read and run the commands in this file.
# Think of it as saying, "Hey computer, use Bash to understand what's in this
# file."

# Making Notes in Your Code: '#'
# Just like in other programming languages, you can add notes to your Bash code.
# In Bash, you use the '#' symbol to start a note (called a "comment"). Anything
# you write after a '#' on a line is just for you and other people reading your
# code. The computer will completely ignore it when it runs the script. So, feel
# free to add lots of comments to explain what your code is doing. These notes
# won't slow down your script or make it bigger. When Bash reads your script, it
# skips over all the comments and tries to be efficient with things like spaces.

# Let's get started!
