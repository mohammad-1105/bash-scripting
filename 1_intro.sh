#!/bin/bash

# Bash (Bourne Again SHELL ) is a Unix shell and command language. It is widely available on various operating systems, and it is also the default command interpreter on most Linux systems.

# Let's start with the hello world

echo "Hello World" # run this script ./1_intro.sh in the cli to see the magic

# echo is like 'print' in python, console.log() in js
# I know are you are curious about this #!/bin/bash written on top. This is called shebang. Got confuse ?? Don't worry it just tells the operating system to execute the script using the Bash interpreter 

# NOTE: Just like every programming language has comments, in Bash, the `#` symbol is used to add them. Don't worry about writing many comments in your code; they won't affect its execution. During compilation (or interpretation, in Bash's case), the interpreter ignores comments and often optimizes whitespace to make your code more efficient.
